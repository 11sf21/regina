  <div id="memories"> Regina was an alright city to grow up in.
  There was wide open wheat fields two blocks away from my house that were beautiful
  in the summer. We also lived under the flight path for the airport, so we always 
  had passenger planes flying low over the house. There was also a lot of <span id="crime">crime</span> too though.
  I had my car window smashed in and stuff stolen. I also had my car totalled while parked
  in front of my house by a kid driving a stolen car. That sucked.
